These steps include a 10-day design phase and a 5-day initial draft of the content. After the design phase, there is a 2-day development phase. Following this, the need for a marketing review is assessed. If the review is deemed necessary by 40%, then 4 days are allocated for the preparation of the final version. However, if the review is deemed necessary by 60%, then the marketing review takes place and the process ends. After the marketing review, there is a 3-day building phase, followed by a 1-day checking phase. If the outcome of the checking phase is not approval, then an additional 3 days are allocated for building. However, if the outcome is approval, then the process comes to an end.",

Otherwise, if the result is \"Y\", allocate system resources. In case of rejection, notify the Business of the rejection reasons. For the allocated system resources, build servers with the Operating system and business application. After that, receive the rejection notice and update the business request.

Otherwise, if the inventory is above the minimum, the process ends. After creating the purchase order, review it. If the order is approved, continue the process.

After reading the container sensor data, the flowers are classified. The step of reading the container sensor data produces a data object called \"Flower info\".

This step requires accessing the data object \"Classification rules\" as well as the data object \"Flower info\". Additionally, the step of classifying flowers requires accessing the data object \"Classification rules\" and the data object \"Flower info\". Once the flowers are classified, a truck is selected. A warehouse query request is then sent, followed by receiving candidate warehouse information. The step of sending the warehouse query request requires accessing the data object \"Classified flowers list\". Simultaneously, the following steps are completed: sending a warehouse query request and sending booking requests. Finally, the flowers are delivered, and the process ends. For the warehouse, the process begins with analyzing the request. If the request is to query archived data, then the process continues. If the request is to make an observation by invoking the sensor service, then the process also continues. After that, a response is sent and the database is updated, and the process ends. The step of sending the response and updating the database requires accessing the data object \"sensor data\".",

After logging in, the client can input their issue into the Helpdesk. This will create a new issue log with the state \"Unregistered\". Once the new issue log is created, a new notification is fired and registered. The state of the issue is then changed to \"Registered\". The appropriate developer is acknowledged unless the client chooses an alternate developer. If an alternate developer is chosen, they are acknowledged instead. If the client does not choose an alternate developer, the appropriate developer is assigned to the issue. After assigning the developer, the state of the issue is changed to \"Confirmed\". The issue solver is then changed accordingly and the manager is informed. The next step is to communicate with the developer to help solve the problem. During this communication, a message log is created. If the client chooses to mark the issue as solved, the state of the issue is changed to \"Solved\" and the process ends.",

At the same time, complete the following steps: send the payment report to the Accounts Receivable Department and also send it to the registry. Once the payment report has been sent to the Accounts Receivable Department, generate monthly invoices for clients. Additionally, send the payment report to the registry and select the paper-based invoices that have been paid. After generating the monthly invoices for clients, charge the client $35 per invoice. Once the client has been charged, the process comes to an end. Simultaneously, archive the invoices per vendor and track down payment. Archive the invoices per vendor first, and then proceed to archive the invoices per payment data. Finally, track down payment and conclude the process by archiving the invoices per payment data.",

    "procedure_text": "To begin the process at the hospital, start by receiving the patient's description. Simultaneously, complete the following steps: inquire about the doctor's whereabouts and contact an available home doctor. After inquiring about the doctor's whereabouts, proceed to calm the patient. Contact the available home doctor and then study the patient's state. Once the patient is calm, inquire about the doctor's whereabouts again. Study the patient's state and then go to the patient's home. Upon arriving at the patient's home, receive the symptoms. If the patient requires home treatment, continue with the process. However, if the patient needs to be taken to the hospital, call an ambulance. Once back at the hospital, the process concludes. For the patient, the process begins by feeling sick and then finding the hospital's phone number. After finding the hospital's phone number, ask the hospital for a home doctor. Wait for 30 minutes and then inquire about the doctor's position.",

After that, proceed with registering the gross pathology request and assigning a container to it. During the registration of the gross pathology request, make sure to focus on the creation of case numbers and the start of the process. Additionally, print the case numbers. Once the container has been assigned to the gross pathology request, provide a description of the specimen. When describing the specimen, pay attention to the Point of Measurement (PoM) using a barcode reader in the basement. If the registration of the gross pathology request is ongoing, then proceed with writing the macroscopic description. Check if digitalization is required. If not, continue with the process. If yes, proceed with digitalization. If tissue processing is required, continue with the check for digitalization. When writing the macroscopic description, the PoM Secretary should be involved. After assigning the cases to the pathologist, perform the microscopic examination and diagnosis. Following that, write the pathology report. During the microscopic examination and diagnosis, pay attention to the PoM, which is located inside the offices of the doctors (3). Once the pathology report has been written, confirm it. The confirmation should be done by the PoM Secretary. After confirming the pathology report, deliver it. The delivery should also be done by the PoM, who is located inside the offices of the doctors (3). After the delivery of the pathology report, proceed with the post-report processing. Finally, close the pathology procedure, marking the end of the process.",
