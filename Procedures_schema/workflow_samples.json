On the other hand, if the order is accepted, continue the process. In case the order needs to be reworked, revise the purchase order. If the funds for the purchase are reserved, continue the process. Alternatively, if the purchase order is sent to the supplier, continue the process. If the packing slip is received, continue the process. Otherwise, if the invoice is received, continue the process. After receiving and recording the documents, release the reserved funds. Once the funds are released, issue the payment to the supplier. Finally, the process ends.",
